      <h2>Child Custody Representation</h2>
      <p>I develop unique parenting plans to fit your circumstances. I can also litigate child custody issues if necessary to protect your rights to share in the raising of your children.</p>
      <h3>Parenting Plans</h3>
      <p>I work with you to create a comprehensive parenting plan that addresses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allocation of parental responsibilities (decision-making authority)</li>
        <li>Parenting time (visitation schedule)</li>
        <li>Holiday and vacation schedules</li>
        <li>Communication between parents</li>
        <li>Dispute resolution procedures</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Custody Disputes</h3>
      <p>When parents cannot agree on custody arrangements, I will advocate for your interests in court. The court's primary consideration is the best interests of the child, and I will help you present evidence demonstrating that your proposed arrangement serves your child's best interests.</p>
      <h3>Modification of Custody</h3>
      <p>Custody orders can be modified if there is a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's best interests. I can help you seek a modification or defend against a modification request.</p>
      <h3>Enforcement of Custody Orders</h3>
      <p>If the other parent is not complying with a custody order, I can help you enforce your rights through the court system.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How is child custody determined in Illinois?
    answer: Illinois uses the "best interests of the child" standard. The court considers factors such as the child's relationship with each parent, each parent's ability to care for the child, the child's adjustment to home, school, and community, and any history of domestic violence.
  - question: What is the difference between allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time?
    answer: Allocation of parental responsibilities refers to decision-making authority (major decisions about the child's education, health, religion, etc.). Parenting time refers to the schedule of when the child is with each parent.
  - question: Can custody orders be modified?
    answer: Yes, custody orders can be modified if there is a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's best interests. This could include changes in a parent's living situation, employment, or the child's needs.
