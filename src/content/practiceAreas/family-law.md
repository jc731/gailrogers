      <h2>Empathetic and professional family law services</h2>
      <p>Where the law touches on family relationships, the legal process becomes very personal. To help you get through emotionally trying disputes with your spouse or other close relatives, I personally manage every aspect of your case. Family law issues that I regularly manage include:</p>
      <h3>Divorce</h3>
      <p>If you have decided to dissolve your marriage, I can explain your divorce. Illinois is a no-fault state and there are provisions for a simplified divorce. I often help clients negotiate marital settlements to obtain uncontested divorces but am fully prepared to litigate when necessary.</p>
      <h3>Child Custody</h3>
      <p>I develop unique parenting plans to fit your circumstances. I can also litigate child custody issues if necessary to protect your rights to share in the raising of your children.</p>
      <h3>Child Support</h3>
      <p>Illinois has state guidelines for basic child support but many couples need to customize a support agreement for matters such as health insurance, private school tuition, and enrichment activities. I analyze your finances and make the best case for a result that is fair to you and your children.</p>
      <h3>Spousal Support</h3>
      <p>Whether you are the payer or receiver, the issue of spousal support bears greatly on your financial well-being. I gather all the relevant facts to make a compelling case for fair and adequate support.</p>
      <p>On these and many other family law matters, I am prepared to work tirelessly for the results you deserve.</p>
faqs:
  - question: What is a no-fault divorce?
    answer: In Illinois, a no-fault divorce means that neither spouse needs to prove that the other did something wrong. The court can grant a divorce if the marriage has broken down irretrievably.
  - question: How is child custody determined?
    answer: The court considers the best interests of the child, including factors such as the child's relationship with each parent, each parent's ability to care for the child, and the child's adjustment to home, school, and community.
  - question: Can child support be modified?
    answer: Yes, child support can be modified if there is a substantial change in circumstances, such as a significant change in income or the needs of the child.
