      <h2>Mediation Representation Services</h2>
      <p>While mediation is designed to be collaborative, having legal representation during the process can help ensure your interests are protected and you understand the legal implications of any agreements reached.</p>
      <h3>What is Mediation Representation?</h3>
      <p>Mediation representation involves having an attorney present during mediation sessions or available for consultation between sessions. I can help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand your legal rights and options</li>
        <li>Prepare for mediation sessions</li>
        <li>Evaluate settlement proposals</li>
        <li>Ensure agreements are fair and legally sound</li>
        <li>Review and draft mediation agreements</li>
        <li>Advocate for your interests during negotiations</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Benefits of Having Representation</h3>
      <p>Even in a collaborative process like mediation, having legal representation provides important benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal expertise</strong> — Understanding of your rights and legal options</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiation support</strong> — Help developing proposals and responding to offers</li>
        <li><strong>Protection of interests</strong> — Ensuring agreements are fair and comprehensive</li>
        <li><strong>Document review</strong> — Ensuring agreements are properly drafted and legally enforceable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When Representation is Most Important</h3>
      <p>Mediation representation is particularly valuable when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complex financial issues are involved</li>
        <li>There are significant assets or debts to divide</li>
        <li>Child custody or support issues are contested</li>
        <li>You feel the other party has an advantage in negotiation</li>
        <li>You want to ensure you understand all legal implications</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Working with the Mediator</h3>

faqs:
  - question: Can I have an attorney present during mediation?
    answer: Yes, you can have an attorney present during mediation sessions, though some mediators prefer to work directly with the parties. I can also provide representation between sessions and review any agreements reached.
  - question: How is mediation representation different from litigation?
    answer: In mediation, the attorney's role is more collaborative, helping you negotiate and reach agreements. In litigation, the attorney advocates for you in an adversarial court setting.
  - question: Do I need representation if mediation is supposed to be collaborative?
    answer: While mediation is collaborative, having representation ensures you understand your legal rights and that any agreements reached are fair and legally sound. It's particularly important for complex cases.
