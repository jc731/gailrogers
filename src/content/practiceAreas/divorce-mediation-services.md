      <h2>Divorce Mediation</h2>
      <p>Mediation can be a much easier and less expensive way to end your marriage than going to court. As a divorce mediator, I guide couples through detailed discussions of their contested issues to reach a settlement they can present to the court for approval and inclusion in their divorce decree.</p>
      <h3>What is Divorce Mediation?</h3>
      <p>Divorce mediation is a process where a neutral third party (the mediator) helps divorcing couples negotiate and reach agreements on issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property division</li>
        <li>Spousal support</li>
        <li>Child custody and parenting time</li>
        <li>Child support</li>
        <li>Debt allocation</li>
        <li>Any other issues related to the divorce</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Benefits of Mediation</h3>
      <p>Mediation offers several advantages over traditional litigation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost-effective</strong> — Mediation is typically much less expensive than going to court</li>
        <li><strong>Faster resolution</strong> — Mediation can resolve issues in weeks rather than months or years</li>
        <li><strong>More control</strong> — You and your spouse make the decisions, not a judge</li>
        <li><strong>Less adversarial</strong> — Mediation promotes cooperation and can preserve relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Confidential</strong> — Mediation sessions are private, unlike court proceedings</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Mediation Process</h3>
      <p>I guide you and your spouse through structured discussions, helping you identify issues, explore options, and reach mutually acceptable agreements. Once agreements are reached, I help prepare the necessary documents for court approval.</p>
      <h3>When Mediation Works Best</h3>
      <p>Mediation works best when both parties are willing to negotiate in good faith and are committed to finding solutions. Even if you don't agree on everything initially, mediation can help you find common ground.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Do both parties need to agree to mediation?
    answer: While mediation works best when both parties are willing to participate, it can be ordered by the court in some cases. However, voluntary participation typically leads to better outcomes.
  - question: What if we can't agree on everything in mediation?
    answer: You can mediate some issues and litigate others. Many couples successfully resolve most issues through mediation and only go to court on the remaining disputed matters.
  - question: Is mediation legally binding?
    answer: Agreements reached in mediation are not automatically binding, but once they are incorporated into a court order (with court approval), they become legally enforceable.
