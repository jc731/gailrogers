      <h2>Child Support Modification Services</h2>
      <p>Child support orders can be modified when there has been a substantial change in circumstances. I can help you seek a modification or defend against a modification request.</p>
      <h3>When Can Child Support Be Modified?</h3>
      <p>Child support can be modified if there is a substantial change in circumstances, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Significant change in either parent's income</li>
        <li>Change in the child's needs (education, medical, etc.)</li>
        <li>Change in custody arrangements</li>
        <li>Loss of employment or change in employment status</li>
        <li>Remarriage or additional children</li>
        <li>Change in the child's living arrangements</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Seeking an Increase in Child Support</h3>
      <p>If you are the custodial parent and your circumstances have changed, or the non-custodial parent's income has increased, you may be entitled to an increase in child support. I will help you gather the necessary documentation and present a compelling case for modification.</p>
      <h3>Seeking a Decrease in Child Support</h3>
      <p>If you are the paying parent and your income has decreased or your circumstances have changed, you may be able to seek a reduction in your child support obligation. I will help you demonstrate the substantial change in circumstances and work to obtain a fair modification.</p>
      <h3>The Modification Process</h3>
      <p>The modification process involves filing a petition with the court, providing evidence of the changed circumstances, and potentially appearing at a hearing. I will guide you through each step of the process.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How much does income need to change to modify child support?
    answer: There is no specific percentage, but the change must be "substantial." Generally, a change of 20% or more in income is considered substantial, but the court looks at the overall circumstances.
  - question: How often can child support be modified?
    answer: There is no limit on how often child support can be modified, but each modification requires demonstrating a substantial change in circumstances since the last order.
  - question: Can I modify child support if I lost my job?
    answer: Yes, loss of employment can be a substantial change in circumstances that may justify a modification. However, the court will consider whether the job loss was voluntary and whether you are making efforts to find new employment.
