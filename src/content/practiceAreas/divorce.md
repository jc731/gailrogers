      <h2>Divorce Representation</h2>
      <p>If you have decided to dissolve your marriage, I can explain your divorce options and guide you through the process. Illinois is a no-fault state and there are provisions for a simplified divorce.</p>
      <h3>Uncontested Divorce</h3>
      <p>I often help clients negotiate marital settlements to obtain uncontested divorces. An uncontested divorce can be faster, less expensive, and less stressful than a contested divorce. I work with you to reach agreements on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property division</li>
        <li>Spousal support (alimony)</li>
        <li>Child custody and visitation</li>
        <li>Child support</li>
        <li>Debt allocation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Contested Divorce</h3>
      <p>When agreements cannot be reached through negotiation, I am fully prepared to litigate your case in court. I will advocate strongly for your interests while working to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
      <h3>Simplified Divorce</h3>
      <p>Illinois offers a simplified divorce process for couples who meet certain requirements. I can help determine if you qualify and guide you through this streamlined process.</p>
faqs:
  - question: What is a no-fault divorce?
    answer: In Illinois, a no-fault divorce means that neither spouse needs to prove that the other did something wrong. The court can grant a divorce if the marriage has broken down irretrievably, meaning there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.
  - question: How long does a divorce take in Illinois?
    answer: The timeline for a divorce depends on whether it is contested or uncontested. An uncontested divorce can often be completed in a few months, while a contested divorce may take a year or longer depending on the complexity of the issues.
  - question: What is the difference between contested and uncontested divorce?
    answer: An uncontested divorce occurs when both spouses agree on all issues, including property division, support, and child custody. A contested divorce means the parties cannot agree on one or more issues and the court must decide.
