      <h2>Domestic Violence Representation</h2>
      <p>Domestic violence is a serious issue that requires immediate legal protection. I provide compassionate and experienced representation for victims of domestic violence, helping them obtain orders of protection and navigate related family law matters.</p>
      <h3>Orders of Protection</h3>
      <p>An order of protection (also called a restraining order) is a court order that prohibits an abuser from contacting, harassing, or coming near the victim. I can help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>File for an emergency order of protection</li>
        <li>Obtain a plenary (permanent) order of protection</li>
        <li>Modify or extend existing orders</li>
        <li>Enforce orders of protection if they are violated</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Types of Orders of Protection</h3>
      <p>Illinois provides different types of orders of protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergency Order</strong> — Immediate protection, typically valid for 14-21 days</li>
        <li><strong>Interim Order</strong> — Temporary protection until a full hearing</li>
        <li><strong>Plenary Order</strong> — Long-term protection, typically up to 2 years, renewable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Protections Available</h3>
      <p>Orders of protection can provide various protections, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prohibition of contact (in person, by phone, email, etc.)</li>
        <li>Stay-away orders (requiring the abuser to stay a certain distance away)</li>
        <li>Exclusive possession of the home</li>
        <li>Temporary custody and child support</li>
        <li>Prohibition of firearm possession</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Domestic Violence and Family Law</h3>
      <p>Domestic violence can significantly impact family law matters such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Child custody and visitation arrangements</li>
        <li>Property division in divorce</li>
        <li>Spousal support considerations</li>
        <li>Parenting time restrictions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I understand how domestic violence affects these matters and will advocate strongly for your safety and the safety of your children.</p>
      <h3>Immediate Help</h3>
      <p>If you are in immediate danger, call 911. For non-emergency situations, I can help you understand your legal options and take steps to protect yourself and your family.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How quickly can I get an order of protection?
    answer: Emergency orders of protection can often be obtained the same day you file, providing immediate protection. A full hearing for a plenary order typically occurs within 14-21 days.
  - question: What evidence do I need for an order of protection?
    answer: Evidence can include police reports, medical records, photographs, witness statements, text messages, emails, and your own testimony about the abuse.
  - question: Can an order of protection affect child custody?
    answer: Yes, domestic violence is a significant factor in child custody determinations. The court will consider the safety of the child and may restrict or supervise visitation with an abusive parent.
