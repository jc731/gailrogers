      <h2>Child Support Services</h2>
      <p>Illinois has state guidelines for basic child support, but many couples need to customize a support agreement for matters such as health insurance, private school tuition, and enrichment activities. I analyze your finances and make the best case for a result that is fair to you and your children.</p>
      <h3>Child Support Modification</h3>
      <p>If there has been a substantial change in circumstances, such as a significant change in income or the needs of the child, child support can be modified. I can help you navigate the modification process to ensure the support amount reflects current circumstances.</p>
      <h3>Child Support Enforcement</h3>
      <p>If you are not receiving the child support you are owed, I can help you enforce the support order through the court system.</p>
faqs:
  - question: How is child support calculated in Illinois?
    answer: Illinois uses a percentage-based formula that considers the number of children and the net income of both parents. The court may deviate from the guidelines in certain circumstances.
  - question: When can child support be modified?
    answer: Child support can be modified when there is a substantial change in circumstances, such as a significant change in income, a change in the child's needs, or a change in custody arrangements.
